-optical photons are generated...
[x] find out how optical photons are generated
   -I think it uses a decay process

-use a positron as a particle

-seems that Cerenkov Process doenst effect simulation much
       -more optical photons without it than with it

[x] find a way to change output statements at and during a run
   -Check verbosity levels in all files

-photons are absorbed when it doesnt hit a surface

-when using ion just do /gun/particle ion
      -[] find a way to specify what type of ion to use

-added vacuum and properties to setup
       -made world vacuum

-added BC408 and BC418 material

-BC408/418 iformation to put in:
[x] refraction index
   -[x] BC408 = 1.58
   -[x]BC418 = 1.58

[x] energy range
   -[x] BC408 = 100keV to 5 MeV
   -[x] BC418 = 100keV to 10 MeV

[x] absorption length
   -[x] BC408 = 210*cm
   -[x] BC418 = 100*cm

[x] timing constants
   -[x] BC408: slow = 14.2*ns
   	   fast = 2.1*ns
   -[x] BC418: slow = 1.4*ns
   	   fast = 0.5*ns

-Add PMT onto back of light guide
     -[x] make eventinformation file
     -[x] find out how to place pmt at a specific spot
     	 -PMT placement is found in LXeMainVolume.cc in src
     -[x] make pmt SD file
    
     -[x] make cathode 
     	 -out of Bi alkali
	      -Rb2CsSb
	 -[x] check to make sure put in the right place

-[x] Google the difference between optical surfaces
    -ask Brian how to fix this
    	 -[x]add REINDX to light guide
	 	 --WORKS NOW

-[x] try and figure out what poala is doing with the scintillator surfaces

-[x] try combining light guide and thick scintillator into one physical volume and wrap that
     -didnt work

-[x] wrap scintillator properally so that photon goes through and hits pmt 
    -[/] test PMT using cout statments
    	 -Dont work. Need to make the photocathode a sensitive detector
	 -Make PhotoCath a perfect detector (see Brian's code)

-[x] I dont think the photons are reacting with the light guide
    -it doesnt --> changed the material to BC408 and it does react now

-[/] see if you cant add a surface inbetween light guide and thick scintillator that doesnt have any reflective properties and see if that will work
     --not working so far. Need to find the right properties of the wrap

-[//] poala uses a whole object to act as a wrap instead of actually wrapping...try this first
    -make out of teflon since she has it set up already
-wont work

-[//] try making the scintillator out of six pieces (or three...top/bottom, left, and right)
    -after making the six pieces of mylar be sure to make the inside box the scintillator
-->Doesnt work

-[] find a way to fill a histogram where for every photon you get this much energy

-[--] find a way to call a function from one class to another so I can get total photon counts from StackingAction to PMTSD 

-[//] use poala/brian's PMTSD to see if it works and then modify to fit what I need
    -[//] use their eventaction too

-[x] if cant make pmt work, just count photons directly and count the photons as a function of time
    -Pulse Shape Analysis

-[x] have data (number of photons, energy, time) read into a vector for each event

-[] have little scint do the same as big scint
    --Get the hitscollection example from sidssdDetectorConstruction

-[//] work on finding a way to compile root with geant

-[x] write data to a text file
